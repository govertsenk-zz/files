### Biography 

Kris Govertsen is a Masters student at [Northeastern University](http://www.neu.edu) studying [Sustainable Building Systems](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-science-in-sustainable-building-systems-5284/) 

(https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-science-in-sustainable-building-systems-5284/)) and an Interdisciplanary PhD. Her research is focusing on Passive Survivability. Prior to joining Northeastern, Kris was an early college program student at [The Clarkson School] ([https://www.clarkson.edu/clarkson-school](https://www.clarkson.edu/clarkson-school))at [Clarkson University] ([https://www.clarkson.edu/](https://www.clarkson.edu/)). Kris stayed at Clarkson and joined their [Honors Program] ([https://www.clarkson.edu/honors-program](https://www.clarkson.edu/honors-program)) where she studied Civil Engineering with concentrations in Architectural Engineering, Structural Engineering and Construction Engineering Management. For her undergraduate thesis, she proposed a small business called SMART Start House, LLC, aimed at helping the average american family make their homes more Sustainable, Manageable, Affordable, Resilient and Technological. Outside of academia, Kris enjoys skiing (www.mthood.com), [National Parks] (https://www.nps.gov/findapark/index.htm), and taking polaroid pictures.

Michael Kane is an Assistant Professor of [Civil and Environmental Engineering](http://www.civ.neu.edu/) at [Northeastern University](http://www.neu.edu) where his research and teaching focus on human-in-the-loop control of civil infrastructure. Prior to joining Northeastern, he served as a Fellow at the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s (DoE) Advanced Research Project Agency - Energy ([ARPA-E](http://arpa-e.energy.gov/)) where he identified new technology development opportunities for control of civil energy infrastructure, primarily in the areas of transportation, buildings, and distributed energy resources. In 2014, he finished a PhD at the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu) where he pursued novel ways of embedding computational intelligence into civil systems in the Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Technology [LIST](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jerlynch/). Outside the office and lab, he enjoys cycling, games of [ultimate](http://pickupultimate.com/), [skiing](/proj_skiing.php), and [backpacking](/proj_backpacking.php).
